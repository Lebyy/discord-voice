# Download & Update
You can download it from npm:
```cli
npm i discord-voice
```
You can update to a newer version to receive updates using npm.
```cli
npm update discord-voice
```

# Changelog
- **25 March 2021** (v1.0.2) - `WARNING! This update contains some breaking changes in the way start functions works.`
1. Added the system of blacklisting users.
2. Added the system of minimum users in a voice channel.
3. Added the resetGuild function.

# Setting Up
First things first, we include the module into the project.
```js
const Voice = require("discord-voice");
```
After that, you need to provide a valid mongo database url, and set it. You can do so by:
```js
Voice.setURL("mongodb://..."); // You only need to do this ONCE per process.
```

# Examples
*Examples assume that you have setted up the module as presented in 'Setting Up' section.*
*Following examples assume that your `Discord.Client` is called `client`.*

*Following examples assume that your `client.on("message", message` is called `message`.*

*Following example contains isolated code which you need to integrate in your own command handler.*

*Following example assumes that you are able to write asynchronous code (use `await`).*

- **Starting The Voice Activity Tracking**

```js
client.on('ready', async () => {
const StartVoice = await Voice.start(client, false, true);
});
```
- **Voice Time Command**

```js
const target = message.mentions.users.first() || message.author; // Grab the target.

const user = await Voice.fetch(target.id, message.guild.id); // Selects the target from the database.

if (!user) return message.channel.send("Seems like this user does not have any Voice Activity so far..."); // If there isnt such user in the database, we send a message in general.

message.channel.send(`> **${target.tag}** currently has ${user.data.voiceTime}ms of Voice Time!`); // We show the voice time. (OPTIONAL: You can also use the ms package here if you want it to be more concise.)
```

- **Leaderboard Command**

```js
const rawLeaderboard = await Voice.fetchLeaderboard(message.guild.id, 10); // We grab top 10 users with most message(s) in the current server.

if (rawLeaderboard.length < 1) return reply("Nobody's in leaderboard yet.");

const leaderboard = await Voice.computeLeaderboard(client, rawLeaderboard, true); // We process the leaderboard.

const lb = leaderboard.map(e => `${e.position}. ${e.username}#${e.discriminator}\nVoice Time: ${e.voiceTime}ms`); // We map the outputs.

message.channel.send(`**Leaderboard**:\n\n${lb.join("\n\n")}`);
```

*Is time for you to get creative..*
