# Setting Up
First things first, we include the module into the project.
```js
const DiscordVoice = require("discord-voice");
// You need to supply your Discord.Client here with your mongodb URL!
const Voice = new DiscordVoice(client, "mongodb://...");
```

# Examples

*Following example assumes that you are able to write asynchronous code (use `await`).*

- **Starting The Voice Activity Tracking**

```js
client.on('ready', async () => {
const StartVoice = await Voice.start();
});
```
- **Voice Time Command**

```js
const target = message.mentions.users.first() || message.author; // Grab the target.

const user = await Voice.fetch(target.id, message.guild.id); // Selects the target from the database.

if (!user) return message.channel.send("Seems like this user does not have any Voice Activity so far..."); // If there isnt such user in the database, we send a message in general.

message.channel.send(`> **${target.tag}** currently has ${user.data.voiceTime.total}ms of Total Voice Time!`); // We show the voice time. (OPTIONAL: You can also use the ms package here if you want it to be more concise.)
```

- **Leaderboard Command**

```js
const rawLeaderboard = await Voice.fetchLeaderboard(message.guild.id, 10); // We grab top 10 users with most voice time in the current server.

if (rawLeaderboard.length < 1) return reply("Nobody's in leaderboard yet.");

const leaderboard = await Voice.computeLeaderboard(client, rawLeaderboard, true); // We process the leaderboard.

const lb = leaderboard.map(e => `${e.position}. ${e.username}#${e.discriminator}\nVoice Time: ${e.voiceTime.total}ms`); // We map the outputs.

message.channel.send(`**Leaderboard**:\n\n${lb.join("\n\n")}`);
```

*Is time for you to get creative..*
